## RedM Dead Peds Enumerator

This script is designed to delete dead peds for all clients in a RedM server. I have yet to test in an active server so if you do so, feel free to let me know the outcome. Also, no support is provided as this was just to test.

•  Deletes dead peds (excluding players and hunting animals in the ExludedAnimals table) from the Game World.

•  Checks Every 1 minute client-side to add DeadPeds to the table. Triggers every 30 minutes from the server-side to delete the DeadPeds and clear the table.

- This has not been tested in a full server environment.
- Resmon at 0.0 (client and server (svgui on windows)).
- Used about +147.2 kib server and client side.
